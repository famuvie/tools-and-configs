# Why: I like to shuffle my desktop backdrop over a set of images of my choice
# Require: a folder of nice wallpapers and the feh command line tool
# Conifg: set up your WALL_DIR and place this script on your crontab

# END OF CONFIGURATION

cd $WALL_DIR

# Num of images
num=`ls *.jpg | wc -l`

# Random between 1 and that number
val=`shuf -i 1-$num -n 1`

# Get the image file name
img=`ls | head -n $val | tail -n1`

# Set the background
feh --bg-scale $img
